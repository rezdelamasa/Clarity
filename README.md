# Clarity

## About
Clarity is a simple front end app that displays the air quality, pollen levels, and UV index depending on the user's location input. 

The user enters a zip code or city and state. The information is then displayed and the user can toggle between the air quality and pollen tab or UV index tab. The user is greeted with a brief friendly message regarding the current conditions. They can also view the forecasts for air quality or UV on their respective tabs.

## ToDo
* When user clicks day on forecast, show that day's corresponding conditions and information in more detail.
* Instead of requiring the user to input their location, have the browser get the user's location and ask the user if they will like to use their current location.
